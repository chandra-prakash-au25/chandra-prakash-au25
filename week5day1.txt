Tell time complexity of all the problems:
(ignore syntax errors, if any)
Q - 1 )Below are nested “K” for loops (5 marks)
n= int(input(“Enter the limit”))
for i in range(n):
for j in range(n):
for l in range(n):
…
…
…
K for loops in total
…
…
…
for z in range(n):
print(“Time complexity”)
timecomlexity=O(n**k)




Q - 2 ) (5 marks)
n= int(input(“Enter the limit”))
i = 1
while(i
2<=n):
print(“Time complexity”)
i += 1

time complexity=O(log n)

Q - 3 ) (5 marks)
N= int(input(“Enter the limit”))
M= int(input(“Enter the limit”))
a = b = 0
for i in range(N):
a = a + 1
for j in range(M):
b = b + rand()
P.T.O

time complexity=O(m+n)

Q - 6 ) [BONUS QUESTION] (6 marks)
n= int(input(“Enter the limit”))
for i in range(n):
j = 1
while(j<=i
2
):
for k in range(n/2):
print(“Time complexity”)


time complexity=O(n**3)


Marks distribution:
Question 1,2, 3 carry 5 marks each.
Question 6 is a bonus question, that means if you leave that question you don't lose a mark, but
if you solve it, you can get an extra 6 marks.
Remark: maximum marks you can get is 15, bonus question helps only if you are not able to
